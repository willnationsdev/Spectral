When using a skill, a delegate is called. The delegate need only take the SkillUser and the index of the Skill they are using.
The delegate is responsible for...
- establishing animations, if necessary (stopping current one, entering into other animations sequences, etc.)
- setting up Tickers (Timers) for the spawning of SkillExecutors, if necessary
- directly spawning SkillExecutors
- Setting up a Ticker to trigger an "EndOfSkillUse" event, if necessary

SkillExecutors will in turn call delegates whenever they complete that may involve reacting to whatever was "hit"
