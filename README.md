# Project Spectral
A game inspired by Phantom Dust, a real-time action online multiplayer game with mechanics mirroring the Magic: the Gathering trading card game. While Microsoft has decided to create a renewed version of the original game for Xbox and PC (for release in 2017), the gaming community needs a more open, moddable version of the game design that has a better world to explore, better quest design, and better characters. 

To keep up with all updates regarding the game, feel free to check out its Cartrdge Project page:
